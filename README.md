## 1. Summary

- Some customers with religion or dietry constraints are not able to access to spices or sauces available to them

As a owner of this project i would like to come up with an e-commerce store which allows customers to enjoy the freedom of purchasing spices and sauces regardless of their dietry contraints or background
